# promise-from-scratch

This repo is part of my blog post about understanding promises creating one from scratch.

`npm test` will start the tests in watch mode.

`bastard-promise.js` contains the code for our implemented promise.

`promisify.js` shows some examples of turning a callback to a promise.

`node promise-experiment` will trigger the scientits lib experiment.
